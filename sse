You are given a source document containing **15 complete slides/pages of content** for a government-style hackathon project.

Your task is to generate slides while **STRICTLY FOLLOWING a 9-PAGE EVALUATION PROTOCOL**, without reducing the total number of slides.

### IMPORTANT RULES (MUST FOLLOW):

1. **Do NOT remove any slide**. All 15 slides must remain.
2. **Do NOT invent new data, claims, or technologies**.
3. **Do NOT introduce real Aadhaar data or PII**.
4. Use **formal, governance-safe language** suitable for UIDAI / Government judges.
5. Content must remain **explainable, auditable, and policy-aligned**.
6. Maintain **one clear idea per slide**.
7. Use bullets or short paragraphs suitable for presentation slides.

### APPLY THIS 9-PAGE / 9-SECTION PROTOCOL ACROSS THE 15 SLIDES

Map the 15 slides into the following **9 evaluation sections**:

**Section 1: Cover & Context**

→ Slide 2 (Context & Background)

**Section 2: Problem Definition**
→ Slide 3 (Problem Statement)
→ Slide 4 (Problem Scope & Constraints)

**Section 3: Data & Governance**
→ Slide 5 (Dataset Overview)
→ Slide 6 (Data Governance & Privacy)

**Section 4: Methodology**
→ Slide 7 (Methodology Overview)
→ Slide 8 (Data Cleaning & Processing)

**Section 5: Feature & Logic Design**
→ Slide 9 (Feature Preparation)
→ Slide 10 (Logic Behind the Code)

**Section 6: Analysis Framework**
→ Slide 11 (Data Analysis Approach)

**Section 7: Insights & Interpretation**
→ Slide 12 (Analytical Insights)

**Section 8: Communication & Implementation**
→ Slide 13 (Visual Communication)
→ Slide 14 (Source Code & Implementation)

**Section 9: Impact & Alignment**
